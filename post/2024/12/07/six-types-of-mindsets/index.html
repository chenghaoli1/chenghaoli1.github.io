<p>Recently I have been reading this book <strong><Ultimate Mindset Growth Change: Growing Mindset></strong></p>
<p>The book talks about various mindsets that possessed by most people and how these mindsets can change our thinking and behaviours.</p>
<p>Here I list three pairs of mindsets from the book, each pair represent a positive and a negative view of things.</p>
<p><strong>Abundance Mindset v.s. Scarcity Mindset</strong></p>
<p>People who have an abundance mindset tend to think about the things that they have, whereas the scarcity minded people tend to focus on what they don&rsquo;t possess. This difference can sometimes greatly impact our mental health and happiness. For instance, a guy stepped his one foot in a water puddle, and his shoe got wet and muddy. If he got really pissed and upset, which ruined his whole day. On the contrary, if he holds a positive mind, he might go: ah, luckily I still got one shoe dry!&quot; This is a much more positive way to deal with everyday life.</p>
<p><strong>Productive Mindset v.s. Defensive Mindset</strong></p>
<p>This pair of mindsets relates to your performance of dealing with work and study. Having a productive mindset means that you utilise all your resources and energy in the best possible way. On the other hand, those with defensive mindset tend to act self-protective and self-defensive, they only seek for information that seem to be comfortable to them.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed Mindset v.s. Growing Mindset</strong></p>
<p>These two mindsets have been quite more familiar to the public. They are related to how people work on developing themselves, and cope with changes. A person with a fixed mindset may believe their abilities and talents are borned with and the improvement is impossible or extremely hard. When something or situation happens and they can make some changes, they prefer not to alter things and to stay in their comfort zone. Quite the opposite, a person with a growing mindset embraces changes and challenges, they see them as opportunities to improve themselves.</p>
<p>Some of the above content are excerpted from the book <strong><Ultimate Mindset Growth Change: Growing Mindset></strong> by <em><strong>Mequel Henderson</strong></em></p>
