      <description>Obviously, speaking good English is essential to live in the UK. And as a non-native speaker, I often feel there are so many things I need to learn to improve my English speaking skills. Fluency is an important aspect, but not the only thing I should look at. Using the RIGHT works, the way I say it (tone, intonation, accent), and maybe a touch of humor:) can make a huge difference.</description>

      <description>I spent over 400 quid on betting on EURO Cup 2024 and I lost 144. Of course, it might not sound too much, but the point I want to make is not how much I lost rather what lessons I got from it and what YOU can to do avoid.
