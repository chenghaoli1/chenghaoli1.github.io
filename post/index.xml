      <description>Growing mindset is opposite to fixed mindset, it drives people to continue to learn and develop. A person having the growing mindset tends to be more resilient to setbacks and short-term failure. They keep learning from them and adjust their methods and directions to achieve their targets. The key traits of the growing mindset and the difference from the fixed mindset are two aspects:&#xA;Result-oriented vs. Process-oriented&#xA;Growing mindset people focus less on the end results, instead, they care about the process.</description>

      <description>Recently I have been reading this book The book talks about various mindsets that possessed by most people and how these mindsets can change our thinking and behaviours.&#xA;Here I list three pairs of mindsets from the book, each pair represent a positive and a negative view of things.&#xA;Abundance Mindset v.s. Scarcity Mindset&#xA;People who have an abundance mindset tend to think about the things that they have, whereas the scarcity minded people tend to focus on what they don&amp;rsquo;t possess.</description>

      <description>This autumn will leave an important mark on my career life, because in the first time in my life I joined a company for an internship. It was a bite-size internship though (one month, inc. a 7-day national holiday), but at least I can say that my career canvas is now not totally blank (still blank if you see from far I guess).&#xA;Anyway, a brief wrap-up for this experience. The company is HeatMate New Energy Technology, and it is based in Shanghai, China.</description>

      <description>Obviously, speaking good English is essential to live in the UK. And as a non-native speaker, I often feel there are so many things I need to learn to improve my English speaking skills. Fluency is an important aspect, but not the only thing I should look at. Using the RIGHT works, the way I say it (tone, intonation, accent), and maybe a touch of humor:) can make a huge difference.</description>

      <description>Group Photo on Day one in BDSS&#xD;I attended the Birmingham Decarsbonisation Summer School (BDSS) two weeks ago. It was 5 amazing days in the beautiful and historic University of Birmingham. I met some brilliant PhD researchers and post-docs during the event. Industrial experts from National Grid, SSEN, GE Vernova, and many more gave very technical talks. I learnt an awful of insights and knowledge about electrical power system and the challenges the UK&amp;rsquo;s National Grid (NG) is facing in the renewable energy era.</description>

      <description>I spent over 400 quid on betting on EURO Cup 2024 and I lost 144. Of course, it might not sound too much, but the point I want to make is not how much I lost rather what lessons I got from it and what YOU can to do avoid. Realisations stroke me last night when I lost 18 consecutive bets. No matter what strategy I use or how smart</description>
