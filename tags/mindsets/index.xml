      <description>Recently I have been reading this book The book talks about various mindsets that possessed by most people and how these mindsets can change our thinking and behaviours.&#xA;Here I list three pairs of mindsets from the book, each pair represent a positive and a negative view of things.&#xA;Abundance Mindset v.s. Scarcity Mindset&#xA;People who have an abundance mindset tend to think about the things that they have, whereas the scarcity minded people tend to focus on what they don&amp;rsquo;t possess.</description>
