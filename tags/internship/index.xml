      <description>This autumn will leave an important mark on my career life, because in the first time in my life I joined a company for an internship. It was a bite-size internship though (one month, inc. a 7-day national holiday), but at least I can say that my career canvas is now not totally blank (still blank if you see from far I guess).&#xA;Anyway, a brief wrap-up for this experience. The company is HeatMate New Energy Technology, and it is based in Shanghai, China.</description>
